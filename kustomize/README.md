## Declarative Management of Kubernetes Objects Using Kustomize 

> **Kubernetes native configuration management**

* Kustomize helps customizing config files in a template free way.
* Kustomize lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and usable as is.
* Kustomize provides a number of handy methods like generators to make customization easier.
* Kustomize uses patches to introduce environment specific changes on an already existing standard config file without disturbing it.

> **Kustomize is a standalone tool to customize Kubernetes objects through a kustomization file.**

> **Since 1.14, Kubectl also supports the management of Kubernetes objects using a kustomization file.**
